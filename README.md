# HOSTING MUTIPLE WEB-PAGES USING THE ESP8266
This project explains how we can host multiple webpages using the powerfull ESP-8266 chip. Here we will be using the Arduino environment.
We will be starting a server on the ESP-8266 at port 80 and the RESTFULL API's will be used to switch from one webpage to another.

# NOTE:- 
- Before doing this project having a prior knowledge of the following things is necessary
- How to make a web server with the ESP-8266.
- Basic concepts of the RESTful web services.
- What is a station and what is an access point. 

### NOTE: We will be using the HTTP GET requests for this project
