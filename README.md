# HOSTING MUTIPLE WEB-PAGES USING THE ESP8266
This project explains how we can host multiple webpages using the powerfull ESP-8266 chip. Here we will be using the Arduino environment.
We will be starting a server on the ESP-8266 at port 80 and the RESTFULL API's will be used to switch from one webpage to another.

### NOTE 
- Having the basic knowledge of RESTFULL API's will be helpfull.Here for this project we will be using the HTTP GET requests.
- Server can be either  an AP web server or a station web server.
